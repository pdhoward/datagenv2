PROXIMITY TEST DATA PLAN

0. The strategy is to test a platform which facilitates 'direct to market', 'direct to consumer' messaging for a products and events associated with a venue

-------------

This is the physical web, enabled by active signaling from flexible tags operating on the bluetooth standard

1. The complexity of the test data design is high, because of the requirement to test a set of related entities and events. The data entities include

> venues
> subscribers (or visitors to a venue)
> brands (selling or displaying products in a venue)
> tags (BLE devices, low cost, unique identifiers, deployed at mega scale, The tags may be identifying people, product, places or events)
> messages ( scheduled ads associated with a tag and venue )

Beyond these entities, there are a number of other required data stores that are not integral to this test plan, including accounts, payments, passwords, product (detailed pricing, composition, inventory etc), auctions for supply and associated integrations

--------------

2. The app datagenv2 can be used to generate 

> venue data - ingests old venue collection and updates it with additional info. This generates ~3500 stores ... requiring 2 1/2 minutes of run time

> brand, tag and message collections, by ingesting a spreadsheet with a list of all majpr brands, and attaching fake addresses, logos, ids, descriptions. 

> For each brand, 100 tags are generated

> for each brand, 20 messages are generated with a validated tag id and venue id

> For subscribers, fake profiles

> 

-------------

3. For these tests, the default on 'message.target' is 'All', meaning the brand has scheduled an ad to delivered to every venue in which its' product is detected. 

> A product is detected through an active tag. 
> An active tag is detected though a gateway device which ingests signals and posts to the Tag Cloud
> When a subscriber registered to the platform enters the venue carrying a universal card, a url linked to a web page with messages for that venue is conveyed via sms (or a visitor can requesta web page for the venue via a QR Code)

-----

4. Test Process

> a 'tag signaling' emulation server emits a stream of random signals at scale for venues and tags. The signals encompass places and products. This demonstrates the dense, low latency signaling environment of a venue
> a 'tag signaling' emulation server emits periodic random signals for people - demonstrating entry into a venue

------

5. User Stories

-------
> I am a shopper
> I visit a supermarket
> I enter the venue and receive a text message from that venue
> I click on the url which is embedded in the text message
> I recieve a web page with a compilation of messages
> The messages cover product ads, venue messages (ie floor plan), entertainment, games, instructions, warranties and other useful information
> My shopping experience and visit are enhanced

-----
> I am a brand
> I want to promote products which I sell in venues
> I review available venues nationally where my product is detected real-time
> I schedule a message (offer, highlight, warranty ) (and ultimately bid on available ad space)
> My message is elected for that venue, time slot and bid price
> The message is delivered to all subscribers entering the store or visitors requesting the webpage
> I view metrics on the success of my marketing campaign

-----------
> I am a venue
> I carry products with realtime tags
> I use realtime tags on shelves and other store fixtures
> I compose messages for the venue, and schedule delivery times with bid prices
> I accept messages for the venue, from brands whose products I carry
> I can preview a webpage before it is available realtime to venue visitors and traffic
> I maintain my venue profile, providing highlights on venue environment, purpose, traffic, market category, etc
> I view metrics and dashbaord on the success of my messaging service

------
> I am the platform.
> I provide a platform for venues, brands and subscribers to maintain accounts and profiles
> I provide services to compose messages, including text, image, audio, hyperlinks, video, and interactive function
> I provide integration to the Wiliot cloud
> Futures:
- integrations to brands product clouds
- improving set of measurements and metrics via standard and custom dashbaords
- improving web pages with more elegance, organization and functions
- improving set of micro apps, delivered by the platform
